## 📌 API Routes

### 🔐 Authentication Routes

- `POST /api/auth/register` → Register a new user  
- `POST /api/auth/login` → Login and receive a JWT token  
- `POST /api/auth/logout` → Logout and invalidate the JWT token

**Use the returned token in the header for protected routes:**

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

Sample register body: `by default role set to `user` for every account `

```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword123"
}
```

Sample login body: 

```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword123"
}
```

# User Management API

## 👥 User Management (Protected)

### 🔧 General Admin Only
- `PATCH /api/users/:id/role` → Promote a user to admin

**Note:** These endpoints are accessible only to the general admin (`GENERAL_ADMIN_EMAIL`).

## User Profile
- `GET /api/users/me` → Retrieves user profile information.
- `PUT /api/users/me` → Updates user profile details.
---

### Only Admin
- `GET /api/users` → Get all users (protected)

---

## Security Guidelines
- Access to general admin functionality is strictly limited to `GENERAL_ADMIN_EMAIL`.
- All admin-related endpoints are protected to ensure secure and authorized access.

### 📚 Blog Routes (Protected)

- `GET /api/blogs` → Get all blogs  
- `GET /api/blogs/:id` → Get a single blog  
- `POST /api/blogs` → Create a new blog  
- `PUT /api/blogs/:id` → Update a blog  
- `DELETE /api/blogs/:id` → Delete a blog  
- `PATCH /api/blogs/:id/like` → Like a blog post  

---

### 💬 Comment Routes (Protected)

- `POST /api/blogs/:id/comment` → Add a comment  
- `DELETE /api/blogs/:id/comment/:commentId` → Delete a comment

## 🧪 Testing the API

### ✅ Using Postman

1. Register or login to get your JWT token  
2. Add the token to the Authorization header like so:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

You can now access protected blog and comment routes.

---

### ✅ Using Swagger UI

Visit the Swagger docs in your browser:

```
http://localhost:5000/api-docs
```

1. Click the **Authorize** button  
2. Paste your token with `Bearer ` prefix  
3. Test all available routes directly from the browser

---

## 🛡 Security: Rate Limiting

To prevent brute-force attacks and spamming, rate limiting is enabled for:

- **Login**
- **Register**

Each IP is limited to **5 requests per 15 minutes** on these routes.
